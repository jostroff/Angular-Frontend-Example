# Angular-Frontend-Example
 
This is a frontend, angular website for a prototype I've built for a health insurance client of NTT Data, using a complex JSON they gave for a new plan format.

The main endpoint for the table is at localhost:4200/ohi-reports. I used the repository Database-Full_Stack for the connection to the db coming in from the backend portion, for the rest of the dynamic JSONs. That part won't work though since I couldn't include the confidential db attributes. So this is only a prototype.
